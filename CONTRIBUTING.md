## 👋 Welcome

Welcome to the official ArgIt repository! In this file, you'll find a guide on how to contribute to the ArgIt Project.

## 📝 The basics

Before contributing to the ArgIt Project, make sure you have read the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
On top of that, certain restrictions apply to the code contributed to the Fluent language, such as:

- You may not contribute code that is not yours, or wasn't given permission to use
- You may not contribute code that is harmful to the community
- **You may not attempt to pull obfuscated code into the ArgIt Project**
- **You may not attempt to pull malicious code into the ArgIt Project**
- **You may not attempt to pull code that is not related to the ArgIt Project**
- All contributed code should have an explanation of what it does and why it was added, code that is self-explanatory is an exception.

**Please, send any PRs to the `dev` branch, changes are only merged into the `main` branch after they have been reviewed and tested thoroughly.**

---

## 📝 Our standards

Before you jump into editing and/or pulling code into the Fluent language,
make sure your code follows our [Style Guide](STYLE_GUIDE.md),
which provides a set of rules and guidelines to follow when writing code for the Fluent language.

Also, please **Benchmark** your code before submitting it, we want
to ensure that the code you submit is as fast as possible.

## 🤖 Copilot & other AI-generated code

AI-Generated code **might** be allowed in the Fluent language, but it must be reviewed and tested thoroughly before being merged into the `main` branch.

If you are using any copilot-like tool, before submitting your code,
make sure it:

- Doesn't have any unintended side effects
- Doesn't contain any malicious code
- Follows the [Style Guide](STYLE_GUIDE.md)
- Is benchmarked
- Is tested

**AI-Generated Documentation**
Is allowed, but you **must** read it and ensure it is correct before submitting it.

If you are using GitHub Copilot, use the following command to generate a comment with the code:

```text
/doc Document by: brief description, parameters and returns. Do not document every single step that the code performs.
```

> **WARNING!** This is NOT a bash command,
> it works inside the GitHub Copilot chat or inline chat.

**If you are using any other AI tool, make sure to modify the comment accordingly.**
